About Trollocoin
---------------
Trollocoin is a Trollocoin network-compatible, community-developed wallet client.

The project has been designed to provide people with a
stable, secure, and feature-rich alternative to the Trollocoin reference
wallet (https://github.com/trollocoin/trollocoin).

To help faciliate broad community cooperation, a number of trusted
Trollocoin/Peershares community leaders have write permissions to the project's
codebase, allowing for decentralization and continuity. Community members,
old and new, are encouraged to find ways to contribute to the success of
the project. If you have experience with programming, product design,
QA engineering, translation, or have a different set of skills that you want to
bring to the project, your involvement is appreciated!


Development Roadmap
-------------------
* Updated branding and wallet design
* Integrated support for multiple Peershares offerings
* An improved minting experience
