Paycoin version 0.3.1.1 is now available from:

  https://github.com/PaycoinFoundation/paycoin/releases

This is an optional update (for normal users), including scrape addresses and general code cleanup.

For users on the testnet this is a mandatory update as it includes micro-primes for beta testing.

Please report bugs using the issue tracker at github:

Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (this could take a few minutes), then run the installer (on Windows)
or just copy over /Applications/Paycoin-Qt (on Mac) or paycoind/paycoin-qt (on Linux).

If you encounter any issues starting the new wallet it is recommended that you delete and resync the blockchain. To delete the blockchain look in the
Paycoin data directory (listed below) and delete everything except the wallet.dat and paycoin.conf

Linux : `~/.paycoin/`

Windows : `%appdata%\Paycoin`

Mac : `~/Library/Application Support/Paycoin`

It is highly recommended that if you do not have a backup of your wallet.dat
to go ahead and make one before deleting the blockchain.

The listed directories are the defaults, if using the datadir flag make sure to
look in the assigned directory.

If after the blockchain is synced you find your balance is incorrect please run:

`repairwallet`

If using the daemon this can be done the same as any other command, for QT users
please proceed to help > debug window > console and enter the command from there
(you may press escape to close out of the console).

Downgrading warning
---------------------
Normal users are safe to downgrade to version 0.3.1.0.

This is a mandatory update for testnet users, downgrading to a version prior
will break compatibility with the network.

Notable changes
===============

- Scrape addresses (allow scraping the reward off of a stake to a separate address).
- Updated alert key (for use in future releases, do to ban potential from peers this won't be used immediately).
- Managing primenode keys via database instead of in memory vectors.
- Reduced number of primenode keys in code by removing legacy key requirements during sync.
- Checkpoints for the testnet.
- Micro-primes for the testnet.
