Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (this could take a few minutes), then run the installer (on Windows)
or just copy over /Applications/Paycoin-Qt (on Mac) or paycoind/paycoin-qt (on Linux).

In some cases users may be required to delete and resync their blockchain do to
a race/version issue with Berkeley DB. To delete the blockchain look in the
Paycoin data directory (listed below) and delete everything except the
wallet.dat and paycoin.conf

Linux : ~/.paycoin/

Windows : %appdata%\Roaming\Paycoin

Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/Paycoin

It is highly recommended that if you do not have a backup of your wallet.dat
to go ahead and make one before deleting the blockchain.

The listed directories are the defaults, if using the datadir flag make sure to
look in the assigned directory.

If after the blockchain is synced you find your balance is incorrect please run:

repairwallet

If using the daemon this can be done the same as any other command, for QT users
please proceed to help > debug window > console and enter the command from there
(you may press escape to close out of the console).

Downgrading warning
---------------------

Because release 0.2.0.0 implements a protocol update downgrading is not
possible without being disconnected from all updated peers (including the
primenodes).

Notable changes
===============

Primenode stake rates
---------------------

All primenodes will stake at 100% starting April 20th 2015.

Synchronization fixed
---------------------

Synchronization has been patched and should no longer stall every 500 blocks
after block 8045. The patch will fetch new blocks after a given amount of time
if new blocks have not been pulled in.

Remove checkpoint warning
-------------------------

The warning regarding broadcast checkpoints has been removed. The broadcast
checkpoints themselves are non-functional, the future of which has yet to be
determined. Hardened checkpoints are still encoded into the wallet for chain
integrity.

Added listaddressgroupings
--------------------------

The listaddressgroupings function from Bitcoin Core has been merged. It is
recommended that daemon users use this for accounting instead of the
listaccounts function.

Updated qt resources
--------------------

Icons and other image files updated to replace incorrect paybase branding.

Documentation
-------------

Readmes and other documentation updated with correct copyright information and
upstream references.

Many of these were based off of peercoin and/or had out of date links.
