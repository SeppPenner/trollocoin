Upgrading and downgrading
=========================

How to Upgrade
--------------

If you are running an older version, shut it down. Wait until it has completely
shut down (this could take a few minutes), then run the installer (on Windows)
or just copy over /Applications/Paycoin-Qt (on Mac) or paycoind/paycoin-qt (on Linux).

If you encounter any issues starting the new wallet it is recommended that you delete and resync the blockchain. To delete the blockchain look in the
Paycoin data directory (listed below) and delete everything except the wallet.dat and paycoin.conf

Linux : ~/.paycoin/

Windows : %appdata%\Paycoin

Mac : ~/Library/Application Support/Paycoin

It is highly recommended that if you do not have a backup of your wallet.dat
to go ahead and make one before deleting the blockchain.

The listed directories are the defaults, if using the datadir flag make sure to
look in the assigned directory.

If after the blockchain is synced you find your balance is incorrect please run:

repairwallet

If using the daemon this can be done the same as any other command, for QT users
please proceed to help > debug window > console and enter the command from there
(you may press escape to close out of the console).

Downgrading warning
---------------------

Because release 0.3.0.0 implements a protocol update downgrading is not
possible without being disconnected from all updated peers (including the
primenodes).

Notable changes
===============

Normalized stake rates
---------------------

All primenodes will stake at 25% while non-primenodes will continue to stake 5% APR starting July 1st 2015.

Deprecated phase one primenode keys
-----------------------------------

All original primenode keys will be shutdown as of July 1st.

Implemented phase two primenode keys
------------------------------------

Second round of primenodes start coming online 1 week after July 1st and will continue with 2 keys a week until all 50 keys are active.

Added clearorphans command
--------------------------

A rpc command to remove orphaned transactions from the wallet.dat file has been added. Previously only qt wallets were able to remove orphaned transactions.

Added listaddressbook command
-----------------------------

A rpc command to list all the addresses in the wallet has been added. This lists new addresses that do not have a balance on them which otherwise cannot be listed without knowing the account to list addresses from.
